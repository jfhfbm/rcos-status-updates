## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I have continued to work on SplitWireTool.ts. It has taken longer than my other assignments because\
> it is much more involved. I have finished a draft of the code that includes the components that I think are\
> relevant at this time. This week, I finally ran the build and tested it from the terminal using the main\
> designer. It did not work because the new site did not yet have any way to determine if a wire had been selected.\
> So I wrote the function BezierContains in MathUtils to see if the user has clicked on a wire.\

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I will continue to work on this same class, and figure out why it does not work in the main designer.\
> I will do this by using the new function BezierContains() in MathUtils.ts. Using the tests I wrote into the circuit\
> designer, I will continue to debug the split wire tool.\

## Anything Blocking?

> I keep getting tripped up by a lack of general knowledge of the existing code base. At one point, I was manually\
> creating and intiializing wires, not knowing that a nice CreateWire() function had alreday been provided in the\
> Circuit Designer. To mitigate this problem, I've read the circuit designer, and have been paying more attention\
> to my other team members' assignments, so that I can learn from them too.\
