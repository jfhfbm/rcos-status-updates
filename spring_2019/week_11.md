## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I modified Importer.ts and Exporter.ts to make them public functions. In order to do this, I had to learn\
> what a closure is in Javascript, and how closure syntax works. I did this because they \
> contain functions I need to use in CopyController, the class which handles copy and paste functions.\
> I have also finished implementing copy and cut, and just need to implement paste.\

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I will implement paste, and then I will test my code and debug it.\

## Anything Blocking?

> I do not understand one of the function calls for a function I need to use in CopyController. Its syntax is something\
> I've never seen before, and I can't tell what kind of arguments I'm supposed to pass in. I tried figuring it out\
> by looking at where the function is called in another file, but I couldn't figure it out by myself. I will ahve to ask around\
