## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I implemented a Seven Segment Display class in Typescript. It had previously been written\
> in Javascript.  I wrote the class using Sveen Segment Display's super class, Component. I had to implement \
> certain methods that are required from the super class. I am also becoming more and more comfortable\
> with the different ins and outs of this project framework. I was able to work more idnependently this week.\

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to fix a bug in the LED class. Currently, the LED does not light up when it is activated.\
> I have assigned myself to the issue in Git.\

## Anything Blocking?

> Even though the code is still foreign to me, I am becoming more and more used to it. Another blockade I\
> experienced is being unfamiliar with teh workings of Git. When I pushed The Seven Segment Display class\
> there was a merge conflict, and I had to resolve it. That bloacked work for a but, but then I just googled it and\
> fixed it.
