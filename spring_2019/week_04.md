## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I started working on a larger project than usual. This time, I'm rewriting SplitWireTool.ts which\
> creates a new wire port when the mouse clicks and drags on any part of the wire. It's a tool which deals\
> with mouse tracking, inputs and outputs, clicks, and other user actions. I'm refactoring the old code\
> from Javascript to Typescript, and further, from the old design, to the new View-Controller-Model design.\

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I will continue to work on this same class, as it's a bigger project than most fo my other projects.\

## Anything Blocking?

> Since this working with tools is new to me (I'm used to working with functional components like LEDs and Gates)\
> I'm a little anxious about familiarizing myself with new code. I'll do my best though, to puzzle things out using\
> the super classes and the old code.\

## Notes

> This status update was submitted slightly late, I'm very very very sorry :(
