## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I implemented the selection and deletion of wires. I implemented the selection of a wire in the Selection\
> Tool class, and then I modified the Tool manager Class so that when a wire is selected, it doesn't render a rotation\
> circle, since wires can't be rotated. Also, I modified the Selection Popup Controller class to render the wire info\
> box at the correct place, which is just the average middle of the wire.\

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I have chosen another feature from the issue list to implement. I'll be working on wire port selection and\
> wire port properties in the Selection Tools class. Since wire ports are not IO objects, their properties and selection \
> functions are going to be different from the other components.\

## Anything Blocking?

> I have a bug that I cannot pinpoint. For some reaosn, whenever a wire port is spawned, it has a fixed position\
> which doesn't update when the wire port moves, so that the position property of a wire is almost always wrong.\
> This presents an issue for seeing whether or not a port is in a selections area.\
