## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I finally finished and debugged the SplitWireTool.ts class. It now works with a fully updated\
> Bezier curve calculation. I ended making it a child class of the TranslateTool.ts class because thet share\
> so many of their functionalities. This helped to expedite the debugging process as well.\

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I have chosen another feature from the issue list to implement. I'll be modifying the SelectionTool.ts\
> class to be able to select all items when users press shift and A. This is a simpler project, but now I feel\
> much more comfortable working with the tools, and I am confident that I can implement this feature quickly.\

## Anything Blocking?

> Much of the debugging is done by my team leader, Leon. I have started picking up tools like logging to the console\
> to do "print statement debugging", but I still feel uncomfortable with how reliant I am on him.\
