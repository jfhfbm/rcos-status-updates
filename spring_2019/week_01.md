## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I implemented a button class in Typescript. It had previously been written in Javascript.\
> I wrote the class based on context clues from Button's super class, PressableComponent, and I also \
> heavily mirrored another similar component, Switch.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to implement the Seven Segment Display in Typescript. It's constructor will be the \
> the trickiest part, as the old constructor makes use of lots of architecture that no longer exists. \
> The remaining functions will be intuitive. I will also try to write code to render the seven segment \
> display in ComponentRenderer.ts

## Anything Blocking?

> My primary blockade has consistently been acclimating to a reservoir of code that is already written.\
> Since much of the architecture is pre-established, I have to do detective work whenever I code \
> so that my code uses and is compatible with the existing system. At this point, I am still relying \
> heavily on my team leader to explain many parts of the code. From here, I'll strive to become more independent.\
