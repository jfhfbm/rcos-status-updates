## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I kept working on implementing the Copy and Paste function. This task is new for me in scope \
> because it is a controller (and not a model or a view, which is the code type I have previously worked on).\
> That means that this class will interact with the website DOM, and take info directly from the user's \
> clipboard. I have recently found code in the GroupActions code that will be relevant for my task, and \
> generally, I have been situating myself with the task of using even listeners, and other new skills.\

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I will attempt to implement a draft of the code that is at least complete enough to test and debug.\
> I don't expect to finish this week, but I will have working or buggy code at least. 

## Anything Blocking?

> One of my primary blocks is that I will write some portion of code, then talk to my project manager, and realize\
> that I did it wrong because I didn't understadn the framework correctly, or didn't have enough information.\
> In order to rememdy this, there is no option but to keeo chugging along and slowly familiarizing myself\
> with differetn corcners and crannies of the codebase, and continuing to ask as many questions as I can.

## Notes

> This week I didn't get as much done as usual because we have small group presentations.
