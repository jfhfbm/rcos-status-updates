## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I implemented an LED class in Typescript. It had previously been written\
> in Javascript.  LED extends the Component class. So I used this as a guide for implementation. I also modified.\
> the Component Renderer so that the LED would be rendered when lit. Previously, it wouldn't light up.\
> I did this by a building different image when it is turned on than when it is turned off.\

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to write a unit test for the LED class. \

## Anything Blocking?

> I continue to be a little confused about git and its commands. For example, when a commit is merged, I didn't\
> know I was supposed to close the branch or close the issue. Now I know these things and will be neater on \
> github with my work.\
