## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I implemented a 'Select All' function in the Selection Tool class that watches for a user to press the\
> modifier key, then to press the 'A' key. If both these triggers are satisfied, every object on the board gets selected.\
> Additionally, when the wires are selected, it disables the translate and rotate functions in the Tool Manager class\
> because wires can't be rotated.\

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I have chosen another feature from the issue list to implement. I'll be working on wire selection and\
> deletion. I will implement wire selection in the Selection Tool class, and I will implement wire deletion probably \
> in the Circuit Designer class. These tasks are relatively straightforward, and I expect to be able to finish these \
> by next week.

## Anything Blocking?

> In general, I am feeling more confident on working and debugging independently. I know more of the code \
> base, and having made a Tool class myself, I feel much more comfortable working in other tool classes as \
> well. I'm also getting better at console debugging. My usual blocks are resolving themselves... :D\
